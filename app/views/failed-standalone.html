          To protect you against fraud, we can't be specific as to why we're unable to verify your identity. The most common reasons are:
        </p>

        <ul class='list-bullet'>
          <li>the details you provided don't match the information held by the DVLA, HM Passports Office or credit agencies</li>
          <li>there isn't enough information about your credit file or financial history</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your credit score has not been affected in any way during this process.</p>
